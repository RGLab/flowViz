\title{ Adding points within a gate to a plot }

\description{ These methods extend the lattice \code{\link[lattice:llines]{lpoints}}
  methods for drawing of points contained within a
  \code{\link[flowCore:filter-class]{filter}}. They allow for multiple
  dispatch, since not all \code{\link[flowCore:filter-class]{filter}} types
  need to be evaluated for plotting, but this decision should be made
  internally. In any case, we need the raw data in the form of a
  \code{\link[flowCore:flowFrame-class]{flowFrame}}.}

    \item{x = "filter", data = "flowFrame", channels = "missing"}{
      General method for all objects inheriting from
      \code{\link[flowCore:filter-class]{filter}}. This is used as the default
      when no more explicit method is found. It tries to find the
      plotted parameters from the internal \code{flowViz.state}
      environment. This only works if the flow data has been plotted
      using the \code{plot} methods provided by this \code{flowViz}
      package. }

    \item{x = "filter", data = "missing", channels = "ANY"}{ This gives
      a useful error message when we don't get what we need. }

      \code{\link[flowCore:filter-class]{filter}} from its

      re-evaluate.}

      selected points. By default, every subpopulation (if there are
      any) is colored differently.}

\details{ When plotting code{\link[flowCore:flowFrame-class]{flowFrame}}s using the
  \code{plot} method provided by \code{flowViz}, the plotted parameters
  are recorded, which makes it possible to correctly overlay the points
  within \code{\link[flowCore:filter-class]{filter}}s assuming that they are defined for
  the repective parameters. Warnings and error will be cast for the
  cases where the parameters are non-distinct or ambigious. These
  methods are meant to be used within lattice panel functions and are
  probably not of much use outside of those.}
